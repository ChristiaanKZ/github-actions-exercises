3. Once the Codespace is ready, open a terminal and navigate to the project root directory.
4. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`.
5. Start the application by running `npm start`.

The application will start and listen on port 3000. You can access the application by opening a new browser tab and navigating to `localhost:3000`.
